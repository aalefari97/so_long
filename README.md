# so_long

# About the project
I did a top down right and left game, where you have to collect all the diamonds to escape the castle.. It is developed with the miniLibX, the graphic library of the 42 school.

# How to start the game ?

-> You need to compile all source files with make all.

-> To launch the game, execute ./so_long with a map as argument:

- ./so_long maps/map.ber
- ./so_long maps/map2.ber

-> Pay attention: minimize is not working!
